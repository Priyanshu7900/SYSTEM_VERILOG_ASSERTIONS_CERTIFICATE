# SystemVerilog Assertions Basics  

I successfully completed the **"SystemVerilog Assertions Basics"** course on Udemy, which provided a strong foundation in **Assertion-Based Verification (ABV)** concepts using **SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)**. The course covered **immediate, deferred immediate, and concurrent assertions**, along with the use of **sequences, properties, implication operators, and cover properties** to validate both **temporal and non-temporal behaviors** of a design. I gained hands-on experience in writing effective assertions for **protocol checking, design correctness, and functional coverage**, which enhanced my ability to build **self-checking, robust, and reusable verification environments**.
